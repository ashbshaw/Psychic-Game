# JavaScript-Psychic-Game

This is our first project utilizing JavaScript. We also explored other concepts that were new at the time, such as "if/else" statements and pushing information from the js file to the html file.

In this game, the computer generates a random and secret letter. The player has nine chances to use their psychic abilities in order to guess the correct letter.
